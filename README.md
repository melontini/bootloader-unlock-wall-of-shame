## Why?
Over the past few years, a suspicious number of companies have started to "take care of your data", aka block/strictly limit your ability to unlock the bootloader on your *own* devices.

While this may not affect you directly, it sets a bad precedent. You never know what will get the axe next: Shizuku? ADB?<br><br> 
**They've already gone after [sideloading](https://mashable.com/article/google-android-sideloading-apps-security).**<br><br>
I thought it might be a good idea to keep track of bad companies and workarounds.

If you know of specific details/unlocking methods, please PR them or drop them in the [discussions](https://github.com/melontini/bootloader-unlock-wall-of-shame/discussions)

## 🍅 Just terrible!

### Carrier Locked Devices

> [!NOTE]
> Phone brands handle carrier locks differently, so check your device manual or contact support.

Carrier locked devices are the ones you get after making a commitment with a carrier of your choice. This is quite common in North America and (supposedly) allows you to save some money on your device.

As a rule, almost all carrier locked devices do not allow the bootloader to be unlocked. This usually makes sense, as it would allow you to completely bypass the contract. The problem is that many devices still do not allow you to unlock the bootloader even after the carrier lock has been lifted. For more details, see the [carriers page](./carriers/README.md).

## ⛔ Avoid at all costs!

The following manufacturers allow unlocking under certain conditions, such as region, model, SOC, etc., or require a sacrifice to unlock.

# Misc info

## Custom AVB Keys

Custom Android Verified Boot keys is a feature which allows you to run a custom OS with a locked bootloader.

It's rare to see a device which supports custom AVB keys, but some devices can be found [here](https://github.com/chenxiaolong/avbroot/issues/299).

## Universal SOC-based methods

### Kirin
Kirin 620, 650, 655, 658, 659, 925, 935, 950, 960:<br/>
It's possible to unlock using testpoints and [PotatoNV](https://github.com/mashed-potatoes/PotatoNV) (Read the readme)

### MediaTek
If you own a MediaTek device exploitable by [mtkclient](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient) you can unlock the bootloader using that.<br/>
If it also happens to be an OPPO/Realme device and you need to access fastboot: [lkpatcher](https://github.com/R0rt1z2/lkpatcher) ([web version](https://lkpatcher.r0rt1z2.com/))

### Qualcomm 
https://github.com/bkerler/edl May work depending on the type of qualcomm phone. May not work even with right loader from https://github.com/bkerler/Loaders
if its a samsung or any scummy company which will lock firehose programmers to XBL bootloader version.

The general exploit:<br/>
[alephsecurity.com](https://alephsecurity.com/2018/01/22/qualcomm-edl-2/) the bootloader unlock section.

Xiaomi Mi A1 and maybe all MSM89** manufactured before 2018:<br/>
[EDLUnlock](https://github.com/Giovix92/EDLUnlock)

### Unisoc
If you own a phone with the Unisoc UMS9620 or older,you can use this exploit to achieve temporary secure boot bypass and persistently unlock bootloader(except some devices with modified uboot) [CVE-2022-38694_unlock_bootloader](https://github.com/TomKing062/CVE-2022-38694_unlock_bootloader)

If you own a phone with the Unisoc UMS312 UMS512 UD710,you can use this exploit to achieve persistently secure boot bypass, which means all firmwares including splloader,uboot can be modified and resigned. [CVE-2022-38691_38692](https://github.com/TomKing062/CVE-2022-38691_38692)

Otherwise, you can also look into this: [Spectrum_UnlockBL_Tool](https://github.com/zhuofan-16/Spectrum_UnlockBL_Tool) <br/>
This: [xdaforums.com](https://xdaforums.com/t/alldocube-t803-smile_1-bootloader-unlock-w-unisoc-t310.4393389/) <br/>
