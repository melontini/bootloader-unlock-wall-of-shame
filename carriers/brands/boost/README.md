# Boost

* Verdict **ℹ️ "Safe for now" :trollface:**

Boost doesn't have a wide choice of Android phones, they only have Samsung, Motorola, and phones made by Boost (likely made by a different OEM, similar to T-Mobile, I can't find which OEM though). I can't find anything for Boost-made phones, but their Motorola devices are unlockable via [standard Motorola procedure](/brands/motorola/README.md]
