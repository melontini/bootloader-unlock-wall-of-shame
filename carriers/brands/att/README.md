# AT&T/Cricket

- Verdict: **â›” Avoid!**

AT&T does not allow you to unlock your bootloader until your phone is network unlocked, and AT&T has a history of refusing to network unlock phones for zero reason. However, some recent posts on XDA have claimed the AT&T Pixel 9's bootloader can be unlocked if you set up the phone [without an AT&T SIM inserted](https://xdaforums.com/t/at-t-pixel-9-pro-xl-bootloader-unlockable.4689083/). AT&T also has an artifical blacklist, meaning you are limited only to the devices they officially support. You're best off avoiding AT&T.
