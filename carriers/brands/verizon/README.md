# Verizon/Visible

- Verdict: **üçÖ Terrible!**

Verizon has always been infamously bad for force locking the bootloader. Even dating back to their exclusive DROID series of phones (made by HTC and Motorola) in the late 2000s and early 2010s, you had to use things like SafeStrap to get custom ROMs. Verizon hasn't changed, being very clear that they will not unlock your bootloader, no matter what. In some very very rare cases, people have reported they were able to [unlock their Verizon Pixel's bootloader](https://xdaforums.com/t/just-unlocked-my-vzw-bootloader.4500027/), but this is extremely rare (I can only find one case of this happening).
