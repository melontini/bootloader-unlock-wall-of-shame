# T-Mobile/Metro

* Verdict **ℹ️ "Safe for now" :trollface:**

In general, T-Mobile generally lets you unlock your bootloader, even if your phone is still carrier locked, likely related to the fact T-Mobile has always supported Android (they were the first carrier in the world to sell an Android device), way back in 2011, T-Mobile said on Twitter that CyanogenMod (a very popular custom ROM, now known as LineageOS) was great, and they were excited to see what Cyanogen would do [for T-Mobile's new phone](https://x.com/TMobile/status/60111542494048256). T-Mobile has also seemingly forced certain manufacturers to make their bootloaders unlockable, as phones like the LG G6 (normally not unlockable), is unlockable via the [standard unlock procedure](/misc/general-unlock.md) for T-Mobile models.
Do note that this does *not* account for phones made by T-Mobile, these phones have a number of different OEMs, usually Wingtech for newer models, and [HTC](/brands/htc/README.md) for older models, however they've been made by a varity of different OEMs, including [TCL](/brands/tcl/README.md), [Samsung](/brands/samsung/README.md), [Sharp](/brands/sharp/README.md), Danger, [LG](/brands/lg/README.md) and [Huawei](/brands/huawei/README.md).
