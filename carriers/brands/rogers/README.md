Bootloaders are unlockable, however for devices sold before December 1, 2017, network unlocking is a problem. Rogers directly violates the Wireless Code, forcing you to be a Rogers customer to unlock your phone. If you have a Rogers device and need it to be unlocked, [file a complaint](https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/contact/question.htm) with the CRTC. This is illegal, Rogers legally has to unlock your phone unless it's reported as lost or stolen. Even with modern devices, I'd avoid Rogers because they've shown they have no problem breaking laws.
