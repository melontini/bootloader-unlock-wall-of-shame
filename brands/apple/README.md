- Verdict: **üçÖ Terrible!**

This one is probably expected. No iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch or Apple TV model has had an unlockable bootloader. 

Depending on your device or SoC, there are BootROM (hardware based) and iBoot (software based) exploits you can use to run unsigned code on iOS devices, such as: 
- [checkm8] for A5-A11; <br/>
- [limera1n] for A4, iPod touch 3G, and iPhone 3GS; <br/>
- [24kpwn] for certain iPod touch 2G's and iPhone 3GS's; <br/>
- [steaks4uce] for iPod touch 2G's for BootROM exploits, <br/>
- [DRA] for all 32-bit devices running iOS 7.x.x for iBoot exploits.
