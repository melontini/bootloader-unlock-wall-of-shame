# Micromax

* Verdict **ℹ️ "Safe for now" :trollface:**
* Verdict: **🍅 Terrible!** (Unisoc/Spreadtrum)
* [**🔓️ Unlock Guide**](../../misc/generic-unlock.md)

Despite their sketchy past with using their OTA updater app to [deliver adware][Micromax adware], Micromax follows the [standard unlock procedure](../../misc/generic-unlock.md). Unisoc and Spreadtrum devices cannot be unlocked, this is *not* Micromax's fault, Unisoc/Spreadtrum does not allow unlocking.
