# Realme

- Verdict: **â›” Avoid!**

## Realme

Realme, allows unlocking for supported models and regions. China and India models are confirmed to be supported, with some models from other regions reportedly supported as well. 

To unlock, you need to submit a request through the deep testing app that they publish on their forum. You'll have to find and follow instructions at [c.realme.com](https://c.realme.com/in/). The process is pretty much the same for most phones, but newer models may require a HeyTap account and models that have been dropped out of updating list would be unable to unlock due to "security reasons".

After applying for deep testing, you have to wait 7days before unlocking, although normally the application will be approved at 2am the 6th day. Then you can click "start deep testing" to reboot to bootloader and unlock your phone. But please note that you can only apply for deep testing on the phone running the same Android version it was lauched with. Once got approved, you have 7days to click on "start deep testing", if don't reboot to bootloader then the unlock token would expire and you have to apply again with a different account or after 60days.

It's also worth noticing that Realme China only allows 200units/month for unlocking starting from December, 2024.

### Unofficial Unlock

#### Region Switching

In theory, if available, you could use full-OTA packages to change your phone's firmware region and use the deep testing app directly, but I can't verify that this works (please, correct me if I'm wrong). Guide: [xdaforums.com][Full-OTA region switch]

#### Server Exploit (Obsolete)

In April-May 2023 you could unlock any Realme phone using this script [rmx3474-rooting], but on May 26th Realme posted this announcement on their forum [c.realme.com][announcement]. (They've deleted the original announcement)
Since then, they have forced their servers to only return "new struct" keys, which have model data attached, making the script useless.

## Deep Testing

Deep Testing is the application used to request the fastboot key. Internally, it writes the key to the (oplus/oppo)reserve1 partition, which is later read by fastboot. Realme and Oppo have different versions of Deep Testing, but the apps are almost identical in function.

### Realme

While Realme's posts make it seem like you need a specific version of DT for each device, this is not true. All devices with RUI 2 and below need to use v1.0.0, all devices with RUI 3 and above need to use v1.0.1 or v1.1.0.

**v1.0.1:**
- Changes the signing key.

**v1.1.0:**
- Introduces HeyTap accounts.

#### Debugging

A debuggable version of Deep Testing 1.1.0 has been accidentally released. Equipped with Android Studio, you can execute code with full system privileges (UID 1000, not root).
