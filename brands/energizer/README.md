# Energizer

- Verdict: **🍅 Terrible!**

Not only will Energizer destroy your electronics by leaking battery acid everywhere, but they will also destroy your privacy by not allowing you to unlock your bootloader. There's not much more to say, neither their Android phones or KaiOS phones are unlockable.

Energizer does not share the kernel source code for their devices. As the Linux kernel used in Android and KaiOS uses the GPLv2 license, the refusal to share the kernel source is a violation of copyright law and illegal. The lack of kernel source code severely limits the creation of custom ROMs, and can also at times make it more difficult to root or run GSIs.
