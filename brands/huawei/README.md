- Verdict: **üçÖ Terrible!**

In the past, Huawei allowed you to unlock with a special code you get by submitting some information to emui.com (IMEI, serial, model, and product ID), but in 2018 "corporate values have changed" and the site went down. <br/>
Worse, on Android 10+, the unlock command has been **completely removed** from fastboot.

Certain Kirin-based phones can use [PotatoNV]

Paid methods:<br/>
I don't recommend paid methods due to general sketchiness. I have used one of these tools a while ago, it was okay.<br/>
Through HCU-client (Not everything is supported + incredible prices [hcu-client.com]) or DC-Unlocker (Same problems as HCU [dc-unlocker.com])
