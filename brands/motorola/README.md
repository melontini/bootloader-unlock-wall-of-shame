- Verdict: **⛔ Avoid!**

To start off, to unlock your bootloader you have to submit a request on their website, which is pretty bad on its own (*wink* [Huawei](/brands/huawei/README.md)). 

In addition, [this forum post][Old devices ineligible] says that once a device passes a certain age (the age not being specified), the device becomes ineligible.

Motorola also requires the phone to have a stable internet connection for at least a week for the bootloader to be unlocked, this is not mentioned anywhere on the unlock website but has been confirmed by [posts on the Motorola development forum][Connection Required].

So how do you know if your device is unlockable? Well...

* [This page][Most Devices] says that "Most of our latest devices support our bootloader unlock program."
* [This page][Some Devices] says only "Photon Q 4G LTE, DROID RAZR M(Developer Edition), DROID RAZR HD(Developer Edition CDMA-LTE), MOTOROLA RAZR HD (Rest of World -UMTS/LTE), MOTOROLA RAZR HD (Rogers Canada - UMTS/LTE) and MOTOROLA RAZR i are supported by the Bootloader Unlock site."
* [And from this conversation][turistu's post] [turistu](https://github.com/turistu) had with their support: "most of our E devices doesn't support bootloader unlock program. Please see below a list of devices that support the bootloader unlock program : g100, g51 , g71 , g200 , g52 , g82 , g42 , g62 , g32"
* There's also an unofficial way with CID to check if your device can be unlocked, check here: [xdaforums.com][CID check]

> Moto used confusion! It seems pretty effective...
