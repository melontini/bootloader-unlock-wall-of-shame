* Verdict **‚ÑπÔ∏è "Safe for now" :trollface:** (Pixel 8 and earlier)
* Verdict: **‚õî Avoid!** (Pixel 9 and later)
* [**üîìÔ∏è Unlock Guide**](/misc/generic-unlock.md)

Allows unlocking on almost any non-carrier locked device, but is also a pioneer in making rooting and custom ROMs painful with things like Safety Net and Play Integrity. With the latest feat being RCS messaging which requires DEVICE integrity to work. (To prevent "spam", of course)

Google is also one of the few OEMs to support [custom AVB keys](/README.md#custom-avb-keys).

Despite all of this, Google has started [disabling AI features][disabled ai] upon unlocking the bootloader on the Pixel 9 series, even if you aren't rooted, and it's not related to Play Integrity, and it's likely that in later Pixel models they'll disable more features.
