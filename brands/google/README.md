- Verdict: **⚠️ Proceed with caution!**
* [**🔓️ Unlock Guide**](/misc/generic-unlock.md)

Allows unlocking on almost any non-carrier locked device, but is also a pioneer in making rooting and custom ROMs painful with things like Safety Net and Play Integrity. With the latest feat being RCS messaging which requires DEVICE integrity to work. (To prevent "spam", of course)

Google is also one of the few OEMs to support [custom AVB keys](/README.md#custom-avb-keys).

Google devices require an internet connection to unlock their bootloader, to verify if your device is carrier locked. If this server goes down or you don't have an internet connection, you will not be able to unlock your bootloader.

Despite all of this, Google has started [disabling AI features][disabled ai] upon unlocking the bootloader on the Pixel 9 series, even if you aren't rooted, and it's not related to Play Integrity, and it's likely that in later Pixel models they'll disable more features.
