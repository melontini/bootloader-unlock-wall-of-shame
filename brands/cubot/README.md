# Cubot 

* Verdict **ℹ️ "Safe for now" :trollface:**
* [**🔓️ Unlock Guide (MediaTek)**](/misc/generic-unlock.md)
* [**🔓️ Unlock Guide (Unisoc)**][Unisoc Unlock]


Cubot follows the [standard unlock procedure](/misc/generic-unlock.md) for their MediaTek devices, and the [Unisoc procedure][Unisoc Unlock] for their Unisoc devices.

Cubot does not share the kernel source code for their devices. This is a violation of the GPLv2 license used in the Linux kernel. The lack of kernel source code severely limits the creation of custom ROMs, and can also at times make it more difficult to root or run GSIs.
