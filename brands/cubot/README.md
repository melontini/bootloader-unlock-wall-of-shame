# Cubot 

* Verdict **ℹ️ "Safe for now" :trollface:**
* [**🔓️ Unlock Guide (MediaTek)**](/misc/generic-unlock.md)
* [**🔓️ Unlock Guide (Unisoc)**][Unisoc Unlock]


Cubot follows the [standard unlock procedure](/misc/generic-unlock.md) for their MediaTek devices, and the [Unisoc procedure][Unisoc Unlock] for their Unisoc devices.

Cubot does not share the kernel source code for their devices. As the Linux kernel used in Android uses the GPLv2 license, the refusal to share the kernel source is a violation of copyright law and illegal. The lack of kernel source code severely limits the creation of custom ROMs, and can also at times make it more difficult to root or run GSIs.
