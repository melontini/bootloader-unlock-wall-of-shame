New Devices Until Android 11 with an eng firmware:<br/>

For the rest (seems on new ZTEs doesn't even work anymore as the unlock commandhas been blocked in the code itself into the splloader), use the generic one or if there is the one specific for your device, if doesn't unlock see parenthesis:https://github.com/TomKing062/CVE-2022-38694_unlock_bootloader/releases/tag/1.72
Side note, on the A11 link there is a collection of apps to grant a system shell but them would probably work on old models only
