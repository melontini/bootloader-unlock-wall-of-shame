# OnePlus
- Verdict:  **⚠️ Proceed with caution!** </br>

All of OnePlus' phones are easily unlockable. 
However, do tread with caution as OPPO and OnePlus have merged their codebases into a "unified codebase", so OnePlus can, at any time, has tools to disable their unlocks.
This means OnePlus, at any time, can **completely pull an OPPO** and lock their unlock process.

OnePlus also used to provide Deep Testing for their SIM-locked devices in the US, however they have stopped doing this.
