# Honor

- Verdict: **‚õî Avoid!**
- Verdict: **üçÖ Terrible!** (Unisoc/Spreadtrum)

Following Honor's split from Huawei in 2020, Honor re-introduced the unlock command in fastboot, however when you run it, it'll act like the bootloader has been unlocked, but it [won't actually unlock][fake unlock]. Possibly Honor is slowly re-adding unlocks? No one really knows. Someone in that thread also claims they managed to unlock their bootloader, so maybe bootloaders are unlockable. Best off to avoid Honor for now but things could improve in the future for them. Unisoc and Spreadtrum devices will never be unlockable, this is *not* Honor's fault, Unisoc/Spreadtrum does not allow unlocking.
