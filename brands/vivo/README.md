# Vivo/IQOO

- Verdict: **🍅 Terrible!**

The BBK* family has an unlocking problem. If in case of OPPO/Realme they at least offer an app in some regions, Vivo is locked completely.

Well, that is, if [xdaforums.com][BBK Fastboot] doesn't apply to you.

On pre-May 2022 firmware. I believe these methods *were* ~universal, but proceed with caution:

* Vivo x70 Pro+: [xdaforums.com][Vivo x70 Pro+]
* Vivo Y31 2021: [xdaforums.com][Vivo x70 Pro+]

There is also a chance that your device is vulnerable to one of the MTK or Unisoc [exploits](/README.md/#universal-soc-based-methods).

## Magisk
Vivo devices have kernel-level patches to block the `su` binary, so to use Magisk you should flash this modified version with `suu`.

\* BBK Electronics was deregistered as a company on 7 April 2023.
