# Tecno 

- Verdict: **⚠️ Proceed with caution!**

Tecno requires you to have a [Tecno ID][Tecno ID] for two weeks before the OEM Unlocking option becomes available in the settings. Afterwards, you can follow the [standard unlock guide](../../misc/generic-unlock.md) for devices with a MediaTek SoC, or the [Unisoc unlock guide][Unisoc Unlock] for models with a Unisoc SoC.
