# Tecno 

- Verdict: **‚ö†Ô∏è Proceed with caution!**
- Verdict: **üçÖ Terrible!** (Unisoc)

Tecno requires you to have a [Tecno ID][Tecno ID] for two weeks before the OEM Unlocking option becomes available in the settings. Afterwards, you can follow the [standard unlock guide](../../misc/generic-unlock.md) for devices with a MediaTek SoC. Unisoc devices cannot be unlocked, this is *not* Tecno's fault, Unisoc does not allow unlocking.
