# Nothing

* Verdict **ℹ️ "Safe for now" :trollface:**
* [**🔓️ Unlock Guide**](/misc/generic-unlock.md)

Nothing Phones can be unlocked via fastboot without any codes. The only requirement is 
to enable **OEM unlocking** in **Developer Options** settings page. This is the same procedure as on Google Pixel.

It is reported that Nothing phones support [custom AVB keys](/README.md#custom-avb-keys).
