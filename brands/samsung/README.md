# Samsung

- Verdict: **â›” Avoid!**

If you have a North American device, well, uh... If you're lucky enough not to update for a while, you can check out [this paid service][Paid North American Unlock]. (At your own risk). Any phones prior to the S23 with an Exynos SoC can be unlocked if not carrier locked, regardless of region.

Snapdragon phones prior to the S7/Note7 (2016) can be unlocked regardless of region, as long as it's not locked to a carrier like AT&T or Verizon. The Canadian S7 can also be unlocked as it uses an Exynos SoC, despite Canada normally being a Snapdragon region.

If you bought your phone elsewhere, and it's not carrier locked, you can use the standard process, but brace yourself for all the breakage coming your way! For example, VoLTE on custom ROMs, (thanks to Samsung's proprietary implementation) and in certain cases [even the camera][Unlock Breaks Camera].

Unlocking a Samsung device will also permanently trip Knox. As a result, many Knox-based features will be broken. This includes, but not limited to: Samsung Pay, Pass, Flow, Health, Secure Folder, Secure Wi-Fi, Smart View. Can you be denied warranty? Probably...

## KnoxPatch

Some of Knox-based features can be fixed with this LsPosed module [KnoxPatch] and its companion Magisk module [KnoxPatch#knoxpatch-enhancer].
