# itel 

- Verdict: **⚠️ Proceed with caution!**

* [**🔓️ Unlock Guide (MediaTek)**](/misc/generic-unlock.md)
* [**🔓️ Unlock Guide (Unisoc)**][Unisoc Unlock]

Itel requires you to have a Itel ID for two weeks before the OEM Unlocking option becomes available in the settings. Afterwards, you can follow the [standard unlock guide](/misc/generic-unlock.md) for devices with a MediaTek SoC, or the [Unisoc unlock guide][Unisoc Unlock] for models with a Unisoc SoC.

Earlier, itel didn't require online verification and two weeks of waiting. Things changed.

Also see Tecno and Realme - all these brands are Transsion corp (Chinese, yes)
