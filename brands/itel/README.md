# itel 

- Verdict: **⚠️ Proceed with caution!**


* [**🔓️ Unlock Guide (MediaTek)**](/misc/generic-unlock.md)
* [**🔓️ Unlock Guide (Unisoc)**][Unisoc Unlock]

Latest models of itel come with locked bootloaders. You cannot use "OEM unlocking" option without their account and online approvement.<br/>
Earlier, itel followed the [standard unlock procedure](/misc/generic-unlock.md) for their MediaTek devices, and the [Unisoc procedure][Unisoc Unlock] for their Unisoc devices.
