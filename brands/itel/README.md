# itel 

- Verdict: **‚ö†Ô∏è Proceed with caution!**
- Verdict: **üçÖ Terrible!** (Unisoc)

* [**üîìÔ∏è Unlock Guide (MediaTek)**](../../misc/generic-unlock.md)

Itel [requires you to have an Itel ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootloader_unlocking) for two weeks before the OEM Unlocking option becomes available in the settings. Afterwards, you can follow the [standard unlock guide](../../misc/generic-unlock.md) for devices with a MediaTek SoC. Unisoc devices cannot be unlocked, this is *not* itel's fault, Unisoc does not allow unlocking.

Earlier, itel didn't require online verification and two weeks of waiting. Things changed.

itel does not share the kernel source code for their devices. This is a violation of the GPLv2 license used in the Linux kernel. The lack of kernel source code severely limits the creation of custom ROMs, and can also at times make it more difficult to root or run GSIs.
