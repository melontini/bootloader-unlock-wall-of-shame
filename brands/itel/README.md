- Verdict: **⚠️ Proceed with caution!**

Itel [requires you to have an Itel ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootloader_unlocking) for two weeks before the OEM Unlocking option becomes available in the settings. Afterwards, you can follow the [standard unlock guide](/misc/generic-unlock.md) for devices with a MediaTek SoC, or the [Unisoc unlock guide][Unisoc Unlock] for models with a Unisoc SoC.

Earlier, itel didn't require online verification and two weeks of waiting. Things changed.
