Volla Phones (https://volla.online) can be unlocked via fastboot without any codes. The only requirement is 
to enable **OEM unlocking** in **Developer Options** settings page. This is the same procedure as on Google Pixel. Volla also provides kernel sources & [their entire operating system is opensource](https://github.com/hellovolla).

Volla Phones also support [custom AVB keys](../../README.md#custom-avb-keys).
