# Meizu

- Verdict: **🍅 Terrible!**

There's not a lot to say about Meizu.<br/>
They've never had unlockable bootloaders, and although there are a number of unofficial methods. Some Snapdragon devices have a [FRP exploit you can use in EDL to unlock][fpr-exploit], If your device is unsupported by the FRP exploit and isn't supported by mtkclient, there are [paid services][paid-services] which you can use at your own risk.

Old models on android 1.0-2.0 have a root exploit app available here [meizu-m9-root-app]
