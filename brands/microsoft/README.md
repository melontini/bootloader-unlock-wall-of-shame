* Verdict **‚ÑπÔ∏è "Safe for now" :trollface:**
* [**üîìÔ∏è Unlock Guide (Android devices)**](/misc/generic-unlock.md)

Despite Microsoft normally being a very anti-consumer company, the Surface Duo and Duo 2 are unlockable via the [standard unlock procedure](/misc/generic-unlock.md).

As for Windows Phones, there are no official methods, but an [unofficial method][win-phone-unlock] has been around for a while, and supports all Mirosoft-made Lumias except for the 540 and 535, as Windows Phone hasn't been supported since 2017, it is highly unlikely this is going to be patched.
