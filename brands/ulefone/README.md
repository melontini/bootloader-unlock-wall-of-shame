# Ulefone 

* Verdict **ℹ️ "Safe for now" :trollface:**
* Verdict: **🍅 Terrible!** (Unisoc)
* [**🔓️ Unlock Guide (MediaTek)**](../../misc/generic-unlock.md)


Ulefone follows the [standard unlock procedure](../../misc/generic-unlock.md) for their MediaTek devices. Unisoc devices cannot be unlocked, this is *not* Ulefone's fault, Unisoc does not allow unlocking.
