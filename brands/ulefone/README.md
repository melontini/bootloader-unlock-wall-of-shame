# Ulefone 

* Verdict **ℹ️ "Safe for now" :trollface:**
* [**🔓️ Unlock Guide (MediaTek)**](/misc/generic-unlock.md)
* [**🔓️ Unlock Guide (Unisoc)**][Unisoc Unlock]


Ulefone follows the [standard unlock procedure](/misc/general-unlock.md) for their MediaTek devices, and the [Unisoc procedure][Unisoc Unlock] for their Unisoc devices. However, similarly to Samsung devices, you have to run an extra command to [disable verification][Ulefone verification], or else the device will bootloop upon flashing any partition. You can easily recover from the bootloop by reflashing the stock partition, however.
