# HMD Global/Nokia

- Verdict: **â›” Avoid!**

## HMD

It is not possible to officially unlock most HMD/Nokia phones. However, according to Hikari Calyx, the HMD Fusion series [is unlockable][fusion-unlock]. It's unknown if this is just a mistake from HMD or if HMD is planning on introducing bootloader unlocks.

### Unofficial Unlock

- [ðŸ’¡ Universal SOC-based methods](../../README.md#universal-soc-based-methods)

#### Hikari Calyx's Service

Models released before early 2019 can request unlocking using Hikari Calyx's unofficial service [hikaricalyx.com][hikari-service]

#### Prototype ABLs

Hikari Calyx has a repo with prototype ABLs for some other models. [fih-firmware.hikaricalyx.com][hikari-abl]

#### HMD Device Kit

Models 7.2, 8.3 and 5.3 can be unlocked offline, while others may require HMD Device Kit **which is not public and requires a service account.**
