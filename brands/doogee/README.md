# Doogee 

- Verdict: **AMAZING**

  Just send a email to support-service@doogee.com

  As a last ditch effort I contacted them and they warned me not to unlock - just tell them you are a advanced user and summitw@protonmail.com sent you from github.

  They gave me the firmware, all factory tools for flashing AND instructions WITH a video.

  They asked I dont share the firmware but said they will provide device firmware and tools with instructions BUT no support or warranty after this point. Just send a email!
