# Sharp

- Verdict: **üçÖ Terrible!**

Sharp doesn't allow you to unlock your bootloader and has Fastboot removed from their devices. If you want a Japanese-made phone, you're better off getting a Sony.

While not being mentioned on Hikari's website asides from the "supported devices" list, the Z3, Aquos S2/C10, Aquos S3/D10 and Aquos S3 Mini can request unlocking using Hikari Calyx's unofficial service, under the Nokia/HMD unlock despite the two companies being unrelated: [hikaricalyx.com][hikari-service]
