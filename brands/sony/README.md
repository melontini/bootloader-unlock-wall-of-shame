# Sony

- Verdict: **⚠️ Proceed with caution!**

Sony has an open policy for software developers:
- They are releasing AOSP sources under [Sony Open Devices Program].
- Jolla provides first-class support for installing [Sailfish OS] on select Xperias.

Since Sony likes to ruin a perfect thing:
- Sony requires you to request an unlock code from their [Unlock Service]. They can pull the plug anytime. You have to send your IMEI and agree to possible warranty voiding (many have had their phones repaired/replaced under warranty even after unlocking, just simply flash stock and lock before doing warranty).

Some carrier locked and US devices can never be unlocked. On Sony devices ([but not all?][service-menu-gone]) you can check if the bootloader is unlockable using the service menu.

1. Dial `*#*#7378423#*#*` in the dialer.
2. Tap "Service Info", then "Configuration", then "Rooting Status".
3. Under Rooting Status look for "Bootloader unlock allowed"
4. If "Yes", then the device is unlockable.

Sony supports [Custom AVB](/README.md#custom-avb-keys) Since 2020.
