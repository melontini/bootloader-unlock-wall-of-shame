# Infinix

- Verdict: **⚠️ Proceed with caution!** (MediaTek)
- Verdict: **🍅 Terrible!** (Unisoc/Spreadtrum)

Infinix does allow you to unlock your bootloader, but similarly to Motorola, [you must wait two weeks][Infinix unlock] before you can unlock the bootloader. For models with a Unisoc SoC, you will have to follow the [Hovatek guide][Unisoc Unlock] to unlock your bootloader. Unisoc devices cannot be unlocked, this is *not* Infinix's fault, Unisoc does not allow unlocking.
