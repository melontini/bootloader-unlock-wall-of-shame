# Infinix

- Verdict: **‚ö†Ô∏è Proceed with caution!** (MediaTek)
- Verdict: **üçÖ Terrible!** (Unisoc/Spreadtrum and X6525B)

Infinix does allow you to unlock your bootloader, but similarly to Motorola, [you must wait two weeks][Infinix unlock] before you can unlock the bootloader. For models with a Unisoc SoC, you will have to follow the [Hovatek guide][Unisoc Unlock] to unlock your bootloader. Unisoc devices cannot be unlocked, this is *not* Infinix's fault, Unisoc does not allow unlocking.
***

The X6525B needs [2 week old infinix account and paid tool to ubl](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidroot/comments/1dhvf37/comment/ljjrqzx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
