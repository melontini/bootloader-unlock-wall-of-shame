# Infinix

- Verdict: **⚠️ Proceed with caution!**

Infinix does allow you to unlock your bootloader, but similarly to Motorola, [you must wait two weeks][Infinix unlock] before you can unlock the bootloader. For models with a Unisoc SoC, you will have to follow the [Hovatek guide][Unisoc Unlock] to unlock your bootloader.
