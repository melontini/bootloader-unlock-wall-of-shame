# Umidigi

* Verdict **ℹ️ "Safe for now" :trollface:**

Umidigi phones are generally unlockable, however due to them being a budget-focused manufacturer, they use Unisoc SoCs, and Unisoc requires a bunch of [extra steps to unlock][Unisoc Unlock] for whatever reason, and therefore I wouldn't consider them completely safe. 

MediaTek devices can follow the [**🔓️ Generic Unlock Guide**](../../misc/generic-unlock.md).
