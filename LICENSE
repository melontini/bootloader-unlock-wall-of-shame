# Terms of Use and Information Sharing for bootloader-unlock-wall-of-shame

**Repository:** melontini/bootloader-unlock-wall-of-shame
**Effective Date:** May 17, 2025

## PREAMBLE & PHILOSOPHY

This repository, "bootloader-unlock-wall-of-shame" (hereinafter "The Repository"), is a community-driven effort dedicated to documenting and discussing practices by device manufacturers and software vendors related to bootloader unlocking on consumer devices, primarily those running Android.

Our core philosophy is rooted in:
* **User Empowerment:** Providing users with information and resources to understand and exercise control over the devices they own.
* **Right to Own and Modify:** Upholding the principle that users have a fundamental right to modify, repair, and fully utilize the hardware they have purchased.
* **Transparency and Accountability:** Shining a light on corporate practices that limit user freedom, restrict device interoperability, or undermine the open nature of platforms like Android.
* **Open Information for User Benefit:** Sharing knowledge, methods, and workarounds to help users overcome artificial limitations imposed by manufacturers, based on the open-source nature of Android and the inherent rights of device owners.

This document outlines the terms under which The Repository's content may be accessed, used, and contributed to. It is specifically designed to protect the mission of The Repository and its community from actions by entities that may seek to undermine user rights or exploit the information herein for purposes contrary to user empowerment.

## 1. DEFINITIONS

* **"The Repository"**: Refers to the GitHub repository located at `melontini/bootloader-unlock-wall-of-shame`, including all its files, code, text, discussions, issues, pull requests, wiki pages, and any other associated content.

    * Any subsidiary, parent company, affiliate, agent, contractor, or representative acting on behalf of such entities.
    * Any entity whose primary business involves restricting user control over consumer electronic devices in a manner contrary to the philosophy of this Repository.

This includes contributing to The Repository in a manner consistent with its Preamble & Philosophy.
* **"Hostile Use"**: Any action by a Restricted Entity that involves accessing, analyzing, or utilizing The Content for purposes including, but not limited to:
    * Developing, implementing, or distributing patches, updates, or countermeasures designed to block, impede, or nullify any unlocking methods, workarounds, software tools, or techniques discussed or linked in The Repository.

    * Misrepresenting The Content or the purpose of The Repository to regulatory bodies, the public, or other entities.
    * Treating The Repository as a source of "vulnerability disclosures" for the purpose of patching said "vulnerabilities" when such "vulnerabilities" are, in fact, avenues for user control and ownership consistent with the open nature of Android and the right to property.

## 2. PERMITTED USE OF CONTENT (GENERAL USERS)

Users are granted the right to:
* Access, read, and utilize The Content for Permitted Use as defined above.
* Share The Content, provided that such sharing includes attribution to The Repository and is done in a manner that does not misrepresent The Content or its intent. If substantial portions of The Content are shared or adapted, these Terms of Use and Information Sharing must be referenced.

## 3. STRICT PROHIBITIONS FOR RESTRICTED ENTITIES

Restricted Entities, as defined in Section 1, are subject to the following strict prohibitions:

* **NO ACCESS FOR HOSTILE USE**: Restricted Entities are expressly forbidden from accessing, reading, monitoring, analyzing, or in any way utilizing The Repository or The Content for any Hostile Use. The very act of accessing The Content by a Restricted Entity with the intent of Hostile Use is considered a breach of these terms.
* **NO COUNTERMEASURES**: Restricted Entities shall not use any information, methods, code, or discussions found within The Repository to develop, deploy, or facilitate any software or hardware updates, patches, or changes that would prevent, hinder, or complicate the bootloader unlocking processes or other device modification methods described or advocated by The Repository. The information shared here is for user liberation, not for corporate lockdown.

* **NO MISREPRESENTATION**: Restricted Entities shall not misrepresent The Content or the purpose of The Repository to any third party, including media, government bodies, or other corporations. The Repository is a platform for user advocacy and information sharing, not a "vulnerability disclosure platform" for exploitation by manufacturers to further restrict user rights.

**Restricted Entities that access or use The Content in violation of these terms acknowledge that they are acting in bad faith, unethically, and contrary to the spirit of open information, user rights, and the open-source foundations of platforms like Android.**

## 8. BREACH OF TERMS BY RESTRICTED ENTITIES

Any action by a Restricted Entity that contravenes Section 3 ("Strict Prohibitions for Restricted Entities") or any other provision of these Terms specifically aimed at preventing Hostile Use shall be considered a material breach of these Terms and an act of profound bad faith.

In the event of such a breach:
* The Repository, its Maintainers, and its community reserve the right to publicly document and condemn such actions, including identifying the Restricted Entity and the nature of the breach.
