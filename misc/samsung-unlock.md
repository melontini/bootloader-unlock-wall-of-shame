## OEM Unlocking

To enable OEM Unlocking, you must first gain access to Developer Options.

> [!NOTE]
> OEM Unlocking allows you to unlock the bootloader, but it also disables Google's factory reset protection.

On Samsung devices, you will need to go to "About phone" in the Settings app to unlock the dev options, 
in this menu look for "Build Number", 
now tap the button several times until a confirmation toast/prompt appears.

Now you can search for Developer options and from there enable OEM Unlocking.

## Download mode
Power off your phone. The next procedure will depend on what buttons you device has
- Devices with home button: Hold Power+Volume Down+Home until phone goes to the Warning screen
- Devices with Bixby button: Hold Power+Volume Down+Bixby until phone goes to the Warning screen.
- Devices with neither buttons: Hold down Volume Down+Volume Up, connect phone to computer, continue holding buttons until you see the Warning screen.

The next step will depend on what your device's warning screen looks like.
